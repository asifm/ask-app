# Ask Diary

## An app to teach and help practice the techniques of effectual asking
Every aspiring and nascent enentreprene would benefit from improving their asking skills. We're talking about a specific kind of asking — effectual asking — which is a powerful concept, and is especially of benefit to new entrepreneurs. 

Effectual asking is a central component of the theory of [effectuation](http://www.effectuation.org).

This app will help eentreprneurs
- learn the concept of effectual ask
- track their effectual asks
- practice how to ask effectually
- share their effectual asks with peers for feedback
