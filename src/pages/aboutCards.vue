          <p>
            The goal of these cards is to help you to organize your own effectual Ask process by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Giving you some specific tools to support your work
            </li>
            <li>
              Providing an overall structure for the work
            </li>
            <li>
              Allowing flexibility within that structure
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensuring that basic steps get done
            </li>
            <li>
              Capturing the emerging wisdom on what works
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding some fun to the process
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These techniques should be seen as a set of building blocks for creating a process, not an exhaustive list. Experiment with
            them, discover your favorites, and improvise new techniques. Move quickly through different techniques and ignore
            the techniques that donâ€™t work for you. Try combining different techniques - sometimes the best results come
            from using one technique on top of another.
          </p>
